        <p>
            Most of my project were based on making improvement of work flow at my 
            job as validation Tech. This allowed me to improve my daily job, and update 
            some of the processes. It also allowed me to learn and use Web technologies.

                        Notice there was repetitive process checking results. Using Abaqus Modules, I 
                        used to access the result. Created a displacement and force curve and out put a csv file.

                        The FEA request is a way to communicate what changed on the model and what analysis to perform via a PPT.
                        The problem is PPT is limited and easily lost in a sea of emails. Using electron.js could be easy enhanced
