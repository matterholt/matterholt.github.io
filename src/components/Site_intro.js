      <p>
        Learning never stops, nothing is more evident of that in the web. It can
        build us as a community and destroy us an individual.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Now I want to contribute to the community of those whom share what I
          know, to lift as I climb.
        </li>
        <li>To contribute and add my perspective and flavor of teaching. </li>
        <li>
          I hope to provide another resource for those who want to join to make
          a web a better place.
        </li>
        <li>To help others to solve problems through code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That is another beauty of the coding ecosystem. There isn't too many
        places that will place all there content out there for all to consume.
