I have spent my career performing the validation analysis on automotive chassis systems. The process goes like this; A Mechanical Engineer would build a 3d model that fits within OEM specifications. I would create a 5mm mesh (tiny square) all over the model and would apply virtual loads and requirements that would simulate real world conditions. is called Finite Element Analysis.

> HOT TIP: Getting started with Python a good resource is _[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)_ Written by Al Sweigart.

In 2017 a coworker showed that Python could be used to check result. Python being accessible and required little set for the group. I was able to create a few script to help my team. As I dug deeper in coding, the more I began to enjoy the problem solving and being able to create. Python is awesome, but Python was lacking some flair and then enters the power of the web and it's browser.

> By learning to code, it has improved how I think about problems, by breaking down the problem in smaller pieces and tackling them one at a time.

HTMl, CSS and JavaScript, with these these tool tied together and tossed to the browser it is amazing what can be done on the web. So much info and It felt like which ever way I looked was something new to learn. I fell into web info tornado overload. I spent a lot of hours reading and saving tutorial's that I felt interesting.

> Few quotes that I have picked up a long the way. _You don't have to know everything._ , _You might not know a lot but you know a little_ , _It's not about what programing language that you learn it about how to solve problems_

Learning never stops, nothing is more evident of that in the web. It can build us as a community and destroy us an individual. That is another beauty of the coding ecosystem. There isn't too many places that will place all there content out there for all to consume.

Now I want to join the community of those whom lift as I climb. To contribute and add my perspective and flavor of learning. I hope to provide another resource for
those who want to join to make a web a better place, and to help solve problems through code.
