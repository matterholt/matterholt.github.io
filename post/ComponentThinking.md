# Working in Components

## Components-based Development

In the past, The Web was built using a design system call Separation of Concerns. Where HTML, CSS, and JS would have been separated into designated files, and each language has the responsibility of performing a specific task for the Web page. With the rise of the library, React.js has shifted the way we construct our application into what we call a component-based development. That would encapsulate markup, style, and logic into one section.

> HTML organizes the web content,
CSS styles the content,
JS is how to interact with content

## Benefits of component base

The community has adopted this design system to be a good direction to build web applications. What does it offer to use to start thinking of our app as a component-based development?  I am fairly young in my developer career (Started Aug 2017) but from my experiences, I can see how this concept can excel.   

Focus, Being able to extract a feature out into its own component. It would allow the developer to focus on a smaller task and not get overwhelmed by the amount of work. Modular, With all 3 languages encapsulated into a single piece of code allows the developer to tear out a piece or pull in a component. Finally able to test the UI. Currently, I'm a bit lacking in this area but if we use the Functional Programing where a function only does one thing than any testing should be easier.

> Encapsulation, Like boxing them up and keeping them from being affect buy other parts of the code.

## What does Component look like

Enough theory let's see how this look in the wild.

A tricky question and very lose description. Open a web page and every Html tag can be a component.
