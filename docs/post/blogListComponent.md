# Blog List Component Build

building a blog is easy. but there are thing we need to think about

## Tech Stack

Not going to lie but it is mostly determined buy personal preference. but I want to keep an open mind and I want to learn new thing. but i want to stick with react base

## Component Concept

The concept of building Component (when was the time fo component)

We have our top layer components, now we are able to break down the component into smaller bite size pieces allowing us to focus on a small task and not get over whelmed with the amount of work that need to be done. Using Next.js can help us a little to organize the components. But keeps to the the spirit of React and allows us to buid in a way of our preference. My plan of attack is having the blog.js file in the page directory which will allow us to be able to route to the page. Anything create will placed into a self created directory call component and a style folder will be in the same directory for the component created.

- Keep in mind that code is for people. If a patterns and a best practices are fallowed, would help us out next year when we go to update it.

## User story

## What the component needs and how different webpages show data

< basic sketch>

As a user of the page we should ask ourselves how should the list of post be viewed. The simplest option would be tile and the whole post and we would need another page. but 300 post later the page would be get messy. Could be difficult finding a specific post and could lead to performance issues. When start thinking if a user using your site, they might not need every post you have written.

So we will research other blogs we can get an idea of how handle the page. Specifically the component with in the blog list. Every post has a similar info show to the user. Title, date, Tag, a slug of the article. Other option would be image, author and other things. I think the first 4 things will be enough.

## Design

Disclaimer : I am not a designer but I like things to look good.
So using other peoples blog list card examples. we can have a good idea on styling. What do we get if we keep it simple and use HTML hard coded. to Codepen we go... [noStyle blog card][1].
