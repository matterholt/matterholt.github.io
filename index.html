        <p>
          Interested in building User Interfaces for web related content.
          React.js is the my chosen library to help building UI. Along with
          the whole ecosystem for a React application. I have favored NEXT.js
          for a more Framework for React. but have dabbled Gatsby as well. Currently
          an interest in the JAMstack for building e-commerce.

        <p>
          Having a better understanding of the web as a whole. I have spent some playing around with
          Django for the monolithic application, Django REST framework allowing React Front end. Also
          used express.js a bit for some JS backend.

        <h3 class="landing__subtitle"> Core Ideas</h3>
        <p>
          These ideas are pretty common and I have herd them many times, and I try to
          keep them in mind but can be difficult to observe but I hope to do my best
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I don't know everything but I do know a little. A quote I heard few years back
            there is too much to learn and that is OK cause there are somethings
            that you know. So share it in your own perspective.
          </li>
          <li>
            Though these tools help build UI very quickly and efficient. All have been built on the foundation
            of the web. which are HTML, CSS, and JS. Keeping the to the basics will ensure that whatever new
            framework
            show I will be able to still build user interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Making web accessible to all, Considering color to keep the web easily
            readable. Using correct HTML tags for screen readers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Share the things that you have learn to be able to contribute
            back to the community
          </li>
          <li>
            Spend a few hours building an old school webpage will make you appreciate modern
            frameworks or library
