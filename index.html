        This page is going to try to stay generic as possible. Allowing gain perspective on how
        webpages where built in the past. By reducing complications I hope be able to focus on
        managing css and HTML tags. A change log of additions can be found
        <a href="docs/changeLog.html">Tech Change log</a> Here I will explain why the tech was added and
        the benefits of adding something like it to the webpages.
