   <h2> Building a Blogging Platform </h2>
   <p>
    I feel as everyone should have a blog-type platform. Especially if there is an interest to learn about a thing. I have spent
    the past previous years documenting on pen and paper only to have the info lost. Then switch to Notion which is great and I will
    continue to document but it lacks a public face and can get messy (at least for me). So I think it is time to build a blog using
		a blog.A personal blog is a pretty simple, there are not too many moving parts but is how we are going to exicute the parts. 
    </p>

    <h3>What is the desired build</h3>

      <p>
			Before we get started building on the blog. It would be good to get an idea on how we want exaclty we want to do with the blog.
      If we want to start putting content out probably something like Medium or DEV.TO would work. Just signing up will allow you to 
			posting and there is no need to build anything. By far the easiest avenue, but it leave me unsatisfied. I want to be a good 
			Front-end Developer and I want to make it my own and I want to create more a note book for my self.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			So the personal blog, allow me to build something which satisfies my passon to learn. Give me place for me to document my journey.
			Allows me to take the freedom to style how I want and use the technolgy that I perfer. With all the freedom does cost something,
			with everything possible then it could be dificult to start. So lets break down into sections and start limiting our possiblities 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Tech-Stack</h3>
			<p>
->			Before we move move foward in designing the blog pages I think we need to address the tech-stack that I want to use for this page.
			This is tough because it can be down with basic html and some css. but this 2020 and we have alot of options and exciting technogies
			to use. So to reduce the scope, so some tech that would produce a static page. It will allow it to be easily hosted and fast. Modern 
			frame-work and allow me to build in components. It boils down to Vue, React and Angular. Though it may be over kill to use these
			frame-work or libary, these are the things being use out in the world and I would like to build and learn more about them. I have
			always found Vue interesting and Angluar I haven't touched but React has been where I have invested of my time so I'm going to move foward with React and 
			using NEXT.js to get the static site. There will be no need for a backend we can just generate it each time a markdown file is added
			to the file.(NEED TO CONFIRM THAT THIS IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN)
			</p>
			
			<h3> Layout/Design </h3>
			<p> I'm not a designer, but I like things to look nice. I guess some product research would be a good idea.
			<ul> 
				<li>DEV.TO -> A blogging platform where you can sign up and post content.</li>
				<li>SmashingMag -> A magazine blog like information center. </li>
				<li>Wesboss -> Personal web site simple and true </li>
				<li> other -> codepen, danabrame, ... </li>
			</ul>
			
			There are basicly
			two pages we need to consern ourselves with.

			ADD WIRE FRAME MOC UP

			ADD WIRE FRAME MOC UP	
			
			<p> 
			First paget is the blog list landing page. The purpose of the are is to list out what post are available and possibly searching
			by tag, or keywords and a quick summary of the post(got to try to hook em).Let break the page down in web page section in which 
			we will call them components.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the simplist form there are three top level components. The Header, the area to let the user what website they are visting.
			Next section could be Page Navigation component, Here we can give the user some option on how to find the articles. Examples would be
			filtering by tag or keyword, sort by date, and maybe a page number. 
			As work the way down that page we can see that we have gotten to the blog lists. This component is at the heart of the user interaction.
			At this coponent should have the title of article, quick summary, tags, and date. 
			</p>

			<p>
			This three component will lay the foundation of the blog build. I want to get things on the page so I will tackle the Blog post List
			first. we have a few
